## Usage Workflow

### For Administrators
1. Deploy the contract (deployer becomes admin)
2. Approve applicants using `approve-applicant`
3. Set academic credentials with `set-credentials`
4. Assign scholarship amounts via `set-scholarship-amount`
5. Enable grants with `toggle-grants`
6. Optionally use `bulk-disburse` for multiple students

### For Students
1. Wait for admin approval and credential verification
2. Check eligibility using `get-student-info`
3. Call `receive-scholarship` when grants are enabled
4. Receive scholarship amount

## Security Considerations
- Only the contract deployer has admin privileges
- Students cannot approve themselves or modify scholarship amounts
- Double disbursement is prevented
- Applicant validation prevents invalid principals
- Scholarship amounts are capped by total fund
